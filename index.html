          <h2 id="sec1">Description</h2> <br>
          <p><strong> Storks are birds measuring up to 100 cm in size and weighing from 2.5 to 4.5 kilograms. Their plumage
            is white, except for the wing feathers, which have black coloring. When the bird's wings are folded, the
            wing
            feathers cover the rear part of the body. The beak and legs of the bird are reddish and long.

            Their voices are weak, and they mostly communicate by clacking their beaks. These clacks are used for
            greeting
            each other and defending the nest from intruders. White storks exhibit a mating ritual characterized by
            clacking their beaks in unison with their partners. Their long, red legs are well adapted for walking in
            water.</strong>

        <div class="migrationbox">
          <h2 id="sec3">Migration and nesting</h2><br>
          <p>In the second half of March, storks arrive in Europe, and at the end of August, they depart for the south,
            covering about 10,000 kilometers. They fly at high altitudes and can cover from 50 to 270 kilometers in a
            day. Stork hunting grounds are in wet meadows, fields, along riverbanks, lakes, and ponds. The birds move
            slowly through these areas, searching for prey, and occasionally catch frogs or fish with their beaks.
            Storks express their emotions with characteristic clattering and beak tapping.</p></br>

          <p> White storks readily nest in populated areas and can even be found in large cities. However, they also
            nest
            far from human habitation, in river floodplains, forests, and along roadsides. Sometimes, their nests can be
            seen even on low tree stumps.</p></br>

          <p>They nest on rocky elevations, trees, buildings, and electrical poles. According to a 1987 census in
            Ukraine, more than half of the nests on trees were built on poplars, ash trees, willows, and oaks. White
            storks prefer humid areas, river valleys, and lowland swamps. A pair of black storks often nests in the same
            place for years, with the female and male reuniting each season. Stork nests are constructed from branches
            and lined with straw, grass, and moss. Initially, the nest is relatively small, about a meter in diameter
            and only a few tens of centimeters in height. Over the years, the nest is expanded and can reach up to 2
            meters in diameter, 3-4 meters in height, and weigh 1-2 tons.</p></br>

          <p>At the age of about four years, a stork becomes sexually mature and ready for mating. In spring, after
            arriving and performing a courtship ritual, a young pair builds a nest, and the female lays 3-6 eggs, which
            are incubated alternately by the female and male for 30-32 days. The eggs are pure white and weigh about 100
            grams each. Hatching occurs in nests in the second half of April to early May.</p></br>

          <p>Newly hatched chicks weigh only 60-80 grams. They are born blind, but their eyes open within a few hours.
            From the first day, the chicks eat independently, and both parents feed them. The parents bring food in
            their beaks or throats and regurgitate it into the nest. In the early days, the chicks receive small and
            tender food like worms, insect larvae, and more. Their diet gradually expands.</p></br>

          <p>The chicks stay in the nest for almost two months. The young birds fledge in the second half of July to
            early August. Usually, 2-4 young birds survive until fledging.</p>

        <div class="feedingbox">
          <h2 id="sec4">Feeding habits</h2> </br>
          <p>White storks feed exclusively on plant-based products. Their diet is diverse but consists primarily of
            small animals, including:</p></br></br>

          <li>Mammals: moles, voles, mice, and other rodents, shrews, young hares, stoats, and water voles.</li>

          <li>In some villages, storks may hunt for chicks and ducklings.</li>

          <li>Small birds.</li>

          <li>Amphibians and reptiles: frogs, lizards, and snakes (grass snakes, vipers).</li>

          <li>Large terrestrial insects and their larvae: locusts, grasshoppers, sawflies.</li>
          <li>Terrestrial and aquatic mollusks, crayfish, and worms.</li>
          <li>Fish.</li></br></br>

          <p>Their diet varies depending on the season. When small water bodies dry up, and there are fewer amphibians,
            storks switch to large orthopterans (grasshoppers and crickets). Storks swallow their prey whole.

          <h2 id="sec5">Population in Ukraine and in the world</h2></br>
          <p>Since 1984, there has been an active increase in the number of storks in Europe, even in highly
            industrialized countries. </p></br>
          <p>According to the 2004 census of white storks, the largest population is in Poland,
            with 52,500 pairs, in Ukraine, there are 12,000–18,000 pairs, in Belarus, there are 10,500–13,000 pairs, and
            10,000 pairs in Lithuania, which has the densest population in the world. </p></br>
          <p>There are 8,500 in Latvia and
            4,000 in Estonia. In southwestern Asia, the largest population is in Turkey, with 15,000–35,000 pairs,
            followed by Spain with 14,000 pairs and Portugal with 10,000 pairs. A non-migratory population is found in
            South Africa.</p></br>

          <p>The white stork is not considered a threatened species.

          <blockquote>Stork is a harbinger of happiness.</blockquote> </br></br>
          <blockquote>In folklore, it was said: "If this bird nests near a dwelling, harmony,

          <h2 id="sec6">Interesting facts about storks</h2></br>
          <p> In many cultures, the white stork is a symbol of good, peace, prosperity, protection, and abundance.
            In Muslim countries, there is a belief that white storks are the souls of the righteous who did not make
            pilgrimages to holy places.</p></br>
            <p>In ancient times, people believed that storks cared for their elderly parents. In ancient Rome, there was a
            law called “The Stork’s Law,” stating that children must take care of their parents.
            Some cultures believed that storks were humans who dressed in feathers when they arrived in their lands and
            resumed human form when they returned to their own. </p></br>
            <p>In Slavic, Baltic, and Germanic traditions, storks are believed to bring happiness, luck, and children.
            Killing a stork or destroying its nest is considered unacceptable in many cultures and is believed to bring
            misfortune and disaster. </p></br>
            <p>Storks are featured on the coats of arms of various cities, ancient frescoes, and coins. </p></br>
            <p>During migration, storks can sleep in the air for up to 10 minutes. A tired bird moves to the center of the
            flock and, using its hearing, takes short naps with its eyes closed without losing altitude. </p></br>
            <p>In autumn, white storks clean their ranks ruthlessly, eliminating weak individuals by killing them with
            their beaks. </p></br>
            <p>Some children are born with red spots on the back of their heads where the neck joins. This phenomenon in
            newborns is called “stork bite,” as it was believed that storks delivered babies in their beaks.
